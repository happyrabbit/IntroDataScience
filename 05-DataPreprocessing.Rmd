# Data Pre-processing {#datapreprocessing}

Many data analysis related books focus on models, algorithms and statistical inferences. However, in practice, raw data is usually not directly used for modeling. Data preprocessing is the process of converting raw data into clean data that is proper for modeling. A model fails for various reasons. One is that the modeler doesn't correctly preprocess data before modeling. Data preprocessing can significantly impact model results, such as imputing missing value and handling with outliers. So data preprocessing is a very critical part. 

![Data Pre-processing Outline](images/DataPre-processing.png){width=90%}

In real life, depending on the stage of data cleanup, data has the following types:

1. Raw data
2. Technically correct data
3. Data that is proper for the model
4. Summarized data
5. Data with fixed format

The raw data is the first-hand data that analysts pull from the database, market survey responds from your clients,  the experimental results collected by the R & D department, and so on. These data may be very rough, and R sometimes can't read them directly. The table title could be multi-line, or the format does not meet the requirements:

- Use 50% to represent the percentage rather than 0.5, so R will read it as a character;
- The missing value of the sales is represented by "-" instead of space so that R will treat the variable as character or factor type;
-  The data is in a slideshow document, or the spreadsheet is not ".csv" but ".xlsx"
- ...

Most of the time, you need to clean the data so that R can import them. Some data format requires a specific package. Technically correct data is the data, after preliminary cleaning or format conversion, that R (or another tool you use) can successfully import it.   

Assume we have loaded the data into R with reasonable column names, variable format and so on. That does not mean the data is entirely correct. There may be some observations that do not make sense, such as age is negative, the discount percentage is greater than 1, or data is missing. Depending on the situation, there may be a variety of problems with the data. It is necessary to clean the data before modeling. Moreover, different models have different requirements on the data. For example, some model may require the variables are of consistent scale; some may be susceptible to outliers or collinearity, some may not be able to handle categorical variables and so on. The modeler has to preprocess the data to make it proper for the specific model.

Sometimes we need to aggregate the data.  For example, add up the daily sales to get annual sales of a product at different locations.  In customer segmentation, it is common practice to build a profile for each segment. It requires calculating some statistics such as average age, average income, age standard deviation, etc. Data aggregation is also necessary for presentation, or for data visualization.

The final table results for clients need to be in a nicer format than what used in the analysis.  Usually, data analysts will take the results from data scientists and adjust the format, such as labels, cell color, highlight. It is important for a data scientist to make sure the results look consistent which makes the next step easier for data analysts. 

It is highly recommended to store each step of the data and the R code, making the whole process as repeatable as possible. The R markdown reproducible report will be extremely helpful for that. If the data changes, it is easy to rerun the process. In the remainder of this chapter, we will show the most common data preprocessing methods.

Load the R packages first:

<!--
```r
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happyrabbit/CE_JSM2017/master/Rcode/00-course-setup.R")
```
-->

```{r, message=FALSE,results="hide"}
# install packages from CRAN
p_needed <- c('imputeMissings','caret','e1071','psych',
              'car','corrplot')
packages <- rownames(installed.packages())
p_to_install <- p_needed[!(p_needed %in% packages)]
if (length(p_to_install) > 0) {
    install.packages(p_to_install)
}

lapply(p_needed, require, character.only = TRUE)
```

## Data Cleaning

After you load the data, the first thing is to check how many variables are there, the type of variables, the distributions, and data errors. Let's read and check the data:

```{r,  results="hide"}
sim.dat <- read.csv("http://bit.ly/2P5gTw4")
summary(sim.dat)
```

Are there any problems? Questionnaire response Q1-Q10 seem reasonable, the minimum is 1 and maximum is 5. Recall that the questionnaire score is 1-5. The number of store transactions (`store_trans`) and online transactions (`online_trans`) make sense too. Things to pay attention are: 

- There are some missing values. 
- There are outliers for store expenses (`store_exp`). The maximum value is 50000. Who would spend $50000 a year buying clothes? Is it an imputation error?
- There is a negative value ( -500) in `store_exp ` which is not logical. 
- Someone is 300 years old. 

How to deal with that? Depending on the situation, if the sample size is large enough and the missing happens randomly, it does not hurt to delete those problematic samples. Or we can set these values as missing and impute them instead of deleting the rows. 


```r
# set problematic values as missings
sim.dat$age[which(sim.dat$age > 100)] <- NA
sim.dat$store_exp[which(sim.dat$store_exp < 0)] <- NA
# see the results
summary(subset(sim.dat, select = c("age", "store_exp")))
```

```pre
      age          store_exp      
 Min.   :16.00   Min.   :  155.8  
 1st Qu.:25.00   1st Qu.:  205.1  
 Median :36.00   Median :  329.8  
 Mean   :38.58   Mean   : 1358.7  
 3rd Qu.:53.00   3rd Qu.:  597.4  
 Max.   :69.00   Max.   :50000.0  
 NA's   :1       NA's   :1        
```

Now let's deal with the missing values in the data.

## Missing Values

You can write a whole book about missing value. This section will only show some of the most commonly used methods without getting too deep into the topic. Chapter 7 of the book by De Waal, Pannekoek and Scholtus [@Ton2011] makes a concise overview of some of the existing imputation methods. The choice of specific method depends on the actual situation. There is no best way.

One question to ask before imputation:  Is there any auxiliary information? Being aware of any auxiliary information is critical.  For example, if the system set customer who did not purchase as missing, then the real purchasing amount should be 0.  Is missing a random occurrence? If so, it may be reasonable to impute with mean or median. If not, is there a potential mechanism for the missing data? For example, older people are more reluctant to disclose their ages in the questionnaire, so that the absence of age is not completely random. In this case, the missing values need to be estimated using the relationship between age and other independent variables. For example, use variables such as whether they have children, income, and other survey questions to build a model to predict age.

Also, the purpose of modeling is important for selecting imputation methods. If the goal is to interpret the parameter estimate or statistical inference, then it is important to study the missing mechanism carefully and to estimate the missing values using non-missing information as much as possible. If the goal is to predict,  people usually will not study the absence mechanism rigorously (but sometimes the mechanism is obvious). If the absence mechanism is not clear, treat it as missing at random and use mean, median, or k-nearest neighbor to impute. Since statistical inference is sensitive to missing values, researchers from survey statistics have conducted in-depth studies of various imputation schemes which focus on valid statistical inference. The problem of missing values in the prediction model is different from that in the traditional survey.  Therefore, there are not many papers on missing value imputation in the prediction model. Those who want to study further can refer to Saar-Tsechansky and Provost's comparison of different imputation methods [@missing1] and De Waal, Pannekoek and Scholtus' book [@Ton2011].

### Impute missing values with median/mode

In the case of missing at random, a common method is to impute with the mean (continuous variable) or median (categorical variables). You can use `impute()` function in `imputeMissings` package.

```r
# save the result as another object
demo_imp <- impute(sim.dat, method = "median/mode")
# check the first 5 columns
# there is no missing values in other columns
summary(demo_imp[, 1:5])
```

```pre
      age           gender        income       house       store_exp      
 Min.   :16.00   Female:554   Min.   : 41776   No :432   Min.   :  155.8  
 1st Qu.:25.00   Male  :446   1st Qu.: 87896   Yes:568   1st Qu.:  205.1  
 Median :36.00                Median : 93869             Median :  329.8  
 Mean   :38.58                Mean   :109923             Mean   : 1357.7  
 3rd Qu.:53.00                3rd Qu.:119456             3rd Qu.:  597.3  
 Max.   :69.00                Max.   :319704             Max.   :50000.0
```

After imputation, `demo_imp` has no missing value. This method is straightforward and widely used. The disadvantage is that it does not take into account the relationship between the variables. When there is a significant proportion of missing, it will distort the data. In this case, it is better to consider the relationship between variables and study the missing mechanism. In the example here, the missing variables are numeric. If the missing variable is a categorical/factor variable, the `impute()` function will impute with the mode.

You can also use `preProcess()` in package `caret`, but it is only for numeric variables, and can not impute categorical variables. Since missing values here are numeric, we can use the `preProcess()` function. The result is the same as the `impute()` function. `PreProcess()`  is a powerful function that can link to a variety of data preprocessing methods.  We will use the function later for other data preprocessing.

```r
imp <- preProcess(sim.dat, method = "medianImpute")
demo_imp2 <- predict(imp, sim.dat)
summary(demo_imp2[, 1:5])
```

```pre
      age           gender        income       house       store_exp      
 Min.   :16.00   Female:554   Min.   : 41776   No :432   Min.   :  155.8  
 1st Qu.:25.00   Male  :446   1st Qu.: 87896   Yes:568   1st Qu.:  205.1  
 Median :36.00                Median : 93869             Median :  329.8  
 Mean   :38.58                Mean   :109923             Mean   : 1357.7  
 3rd Qu.:53.00                3rd Qu.:119456             3rd Qu.:  597.3  
 Max.   :69.00                Max.   :319704             Max.   :50000.0  
```

### K-nearest neighbors

K-nearest neighbor (KNN) will find the k closest samples (Euclidian distance) in the training set and impute the mean of those "neighbors." 

Use `preProcess()` to conduct KNN:

```r
imp <- preProcess(sim.dat, method = "knnImpute", k = 5)
# need to use predict() to get KNN result
demo_imp <- predict(imp, sim.dat)
# only show the first three elements
lapply(sim.dat, class)[1:3]
```

```pre
      age                gender        income        
 Min.   :-1.5910972   Female:554   Min.   :-1.43989  
 1st Qu.:-0.9568733   Male  :446   1st Qu.:-0.53732  
 Median :-0.1817107                Median :-0.37606  
 Mean   : 0.0000156                Mean   : 0.02389  
 3rd Qu.: 1.0162678                3rd Qu.: 0.21540  
 Max.   : 2.1437770                Max.   : 4.13627 
```

The `preProcess()` in the first line will automatically ignore non-numeric columns.

Comparing the KNN result with the previous median imputation, the two are very different. This is because when you tell the `preProcess()` function to use KNN (the option `method =" knnImpute"`), it will automatically standardize the data.
Another way is to use Bagging tree (in the next section). Note that KNN can not impute samples with the entire row missing. The reason is straightforward. Since the algorithm uses the average of its neighbors if none of them has a value, what does it apply to calculate the mean?

Let's append a new row with all values missing to the original data frame to get a new object called `temp`. Then apply KNN to `temp` and see what happens:

```r
temp <- rbind(sim.dat, rep(NA, ncol(sim.dat)))
imp <- preProcess(sim.dat, method = "knnImpute", k = 5)
demo_imp <- predict(imp, temp)
```

```pre
Error in FUN(newX[, i], ...) : 
  cannot impute when all predictors are missing in the new data point
```

There is an error saying “`cannot impute when all predictors are missing in the new data point`”. It is easy to fix by finding and removing the problematic row(s):

```r
idx <- apply(temp, 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
as.vector(which(idx == ncol(temp)))
```

It shows that row 1001 is problematic. You can go ahead to delete it.

### Bagging Tree

Bagging (Bootstrap aggregating) was originally proposed by Leo Breiman. It is one of the earliest ensemble methods [@bag1]. When used in missing value imputation,  it will use the remaining variables as predictors to train a bagging tree and then use the tree to predict the missing values. Although theoretically, the method is powerful,  the computation is much more intense than KNN. In practice, there is a trade-off between computation time and the effect.  If a median or mean meet the modeling needs, even bagging tree may improve the accuracy a little, but the upgrade is so marginal that it does not deserve the extra time. The bagging tree itself is a model for regression and classification. Here we use `preProcess()` to impute `sim.dat`:

```r
imp <- preProcess(sim.dat, method = "bagImpute")
demo_imp <- predict(imp, sim.dat)
summary(demo_imp[, 1:5])
```

```pre
      age           gender        income       house       store_exp      
 Min.   :16.00   Female:554   Min.   : 41776   No :432   Min.   :  155.8  
 1st Qu.:25.00   Male  :446   1st Qu.: 86762   Yes:568   1st Qu.:  205.1  
 Median :36.00                Median : 94739             Median :  329.0  
 Mean   :38.58                Mean   :114665             Mean   : 1357.7  
 3rd Qu.:53.00                3rd Qu.:123726             3rd Qu.:  597.3  
 Max.   :69.00                Max.   :319704             Max.   :50000.0  
```

## Centering and Scaling

It is the most straightforward data transformation. It centers and scales a variable to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. It ensures that the criterion for finding linear combinations of the predictors is based on how much variation they explain and therefore improves the numerical stability. Models involving finding linear combinations of the predictors to explain response/predictors variation need data centering and scaling, such as PCA [@pca1], PLS [@PLS1] and EFA [@EFA1]. You can quickly write code yourself to conduct this transformation.  

Let's standardize the variable `income` from `sim.dat`:

```r
income <- sim.dat$income
# calculate the mean of income
mux <- mean(income, na.rm = T)
# calculate the standard deviation of income
sdx <- sd(income, na.rm = T)
# centering
tr1 <- income - mux
# scaling
tr2 <- tr1/sdx
```

Or the function `preProcess()` can apply this transformation to a set of predictors. 

```r
sdat <- subset(sim.dat, select = c("age", "income"))
# set the 'method' option
trans <- preProcess(sdat, method = c("center", "scale"))
# use predict() function to get the final result
transformed <- predict(trans, sdat)
```

Now the two variables are in the same scale. You can check the result using `summary(transformed)`. Note that there are missing values.

## Resolve Skewness

[Skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness)  is defined to be the third standardized central moment. The formula for the sample skewness statistics is:
$$ skewness=\frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{3}}{(n-1)v^{3/2}}$$
$$v=\frac{\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{(n-1)}$$
Skewness=0 means that the destribution is symmetric, i.e. the probability of falling on either side of the distribution's  mean is equal. 



```{r preprocessskew, fig.cap = "Example of skewed distributions", out.width="100%", fig.asp=.75, fig.align="center", echo = FALSE}

# need skewness() function from e1071 package
set.seed(1000)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), oma = c(2, 2, 2, 2))
# random sample 1000 chi-square distribution with df=2
# right skew
x1 <- rchisq(1000, 2, ncp = 0)
# get left skew variable x2 from x1
x2 <- max(x1) - x1
plot(density(x2), main = paste("left skew, skewnwss =", 
    round(skewness(x2), 2)), xlab = "X2")
plot(density(x1), main = paste("right skew, skewness =", 
    round(skewness(x1), 2)), xlab = "X1")
```

<!--You can easily tell if a distribution is skewed by simple visualization(Figure\@ref(fig:skew)). -->

There are different ways may help to remove skewness such as log, square root or inverse. However, it is often difficult to determine from plots which transformation is most appropriate for correcting skewness. The Box-Cox procedure automatically identified a transformation from the family of power transformations that are indexed by a parameter $\lambda$[@BOXCOX1]. 

$$
x^{*}=\begin{cases}
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{x^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda}\\
log(x)
\end{array} & \begin{array}{c}
if\ \lambda\neq0\\
if\ \lambda=0
\end{array}\end{cases}
$$

It is easy to see that this family includes log transformation ($\lambda=0$), square transformation ($\lambda=2$), square root ($\lambda=0.5$), inverse ($\lambda=-1$) and others in-between. We can still use function `preProcess()` in package `caret` to apply this transformation by chaning the `method` argument. 

```r
describe(sim.dat)
```

```pre

It is easy to see the skewed variables.  If `mean` and `trimmed` differ a lot, there is very likely outliers. By default, `trimmed` reports mean by dropping the top and bottom 10%. It can be adjusted by setting argument `trim= `. It is clear that `store_exp` has outliers.

As an example, we will apply Box-Cox transformation on `store_trans` and `online_trans`:

```{r}
# select the two columns and save them as dat_bc
dat_bc <- subset(sim.dat, select = c("store_trans", "online_trans"))
(trans <- preProcess(dat_bc, method = c("BoxCox")))
```

The last line of the output shows the estimates of $\lambda$ for each variable.  As before, use `predict()` to get the transformed result:

```{r}
transformed <- predict(trans, dat_bc)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), oma = c(2, 2, 2, 2))
hist(dat_bc$store_trans, main = "Before Transformation", 
    xlab = "store_trans")
hist(transformed$store_trans, main = "After Transformation", 
    xlab = "store_trans")
```

Before the transformation, the `stroe_trans` is skewed right. 
<!--The situation is significantly improved after (figure\@ref(fig:bc)). -->
`BoxCoxTrans ()` can also conduct Box-Cox transform. But note that `BoxCoxTrans ()` can only be applied to a single variable, and it is not possible to transform difference columns in a data frame at the same time.

```{r}
(trans <- BoxCoxTrans(dat_bc$store_trans))
```

```{r}
transformed <- predict(trans, dat_bc$store_trans)
skewness(transformed)
```

The estimate of $\lambda$ is the same as before (0.1). The skewness of the original observation is 1.1, and -0.2 after transformation. Although it is not strictly 0, it is greatly improved. 

## Resolve Outliers {#outliers}

Even under certain assumptions we can statistically define outliers, it can be hard to define in some situations.  Box plot, histogram and some other basic visualizations can be used to initially check whether there are outliers. For example, we can visualize numerical non-survey variables in `sim.dat`:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# select numerical non-survey data
sdat <- subset(sim.dat, select = c("age", "income", "store_exp", 
    "online_exp", "store_trans", "online_trans"))
# use scatterplotMatrix() function from car package
par(oma = c(2, 2, 1, 2))
car::scatterplotMatrix(sdat, diagonal = TRUE)
```

<!--As figure \@ref(fig:scm) shows, `store_exp` has outliers. -->
It is also easy to observe the pair relationship from the plot. `age` is negatively correlated with `online_trans` but positively correlated with `store_trans`.  It seems that older people tend to purchase from the local store. The amount of expense is positively correlated with income. Scatterplot matrix like this can reveal lots of information before modeling.

In addition to visualization, there are some statistical methods to define outliers, such as the commonly used Z-score. The Z-score for variable $\mathbf{Y}$ is defined as:

$$Z_{i}=\frac{Y_{i}-\bar{Y}}{s}$$

where $\bar{Y}$ and $s$ are mean and standard deviation for $Y$. Z-score is a measurement of the distance between each observation and the mean. This method may be misleading, especially when the sample size is small. Iglewicz and Hoaglin proposed to use the modified Z-score to determine the outlier[@mad1]：

$$M_{i}=\frac{0.6745(Y_{i}-\bar{Y})}{MAD}$$

Where MAD is the median of a series of $|Y_ {i} - \bar{Y}|$, called the median of the absolute dispersion. Iglewicz and Hoaglin suggest that the points with the Z-score greater than 3.5 corrected above are possible outliers. Let's apply it to `income`:

```{r}
# calculate median of the absolute dispersion for income
ymad <- mad(na.omit(sdat$income))
# calculate z-score
zs <- (sdat$income - mean(na.omit(sdat$income)))/ymad
# count the number of outliers
sum(na.omit(zs > 3.5))
```

According to modified Z-score, variable income has `r sum(na.omit(zs>3.5))` outliers. Refer to [@mad1] for other ways of detecting outliers.

The impact of outliers depends on the model. Some models are sensitive to outliers, such as linear regression, logistic regression. Some are pretty robust to outliers, such as tree models, support vector machine. Also, the outlier is not wrong data. It is real observation so cannot be deleted at will. If a model is sensitive to outliers, we can use _spatial sign transformation_ [@ssp] to minimize the problem. It projects the original sample points to the surface of a sphere by: 

$$x_{ij}^{*}=\frac{x_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{p}x_{ij}^{2}}}$$

where $x_{ij}$ represents the $i^{th}$ observation and $j^{th}$ variable.  As shown in the equation, every observation for sample $i$ is divided by its square mode. The denominator is the Euclidean distance to the center of the p-dimensional predictor space. Three things to pay attention here:

1.  It is important to center and scale the predictor data before using this transformation
1.  Unlike centering or scaling, this manipulation of the predictors transforms them as a group
1.  If there are some variables to remove (for example, highly correlated variables), do it before the transformation

Function `spatialSign()` `caret` package can conduct the transformation. Take `income` and `age` as an example:

```{r} 
# KNN imputation
sdat <- sim.dat[, c("income", "age")]
imp <- preProcess(sdat, method = c("knnImpute"), k = 5)
sdat <- predict(imp, sdat)
transformed <- spatialSign(sdat)
transformed <- as.data.frame(transformed)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), oma = c(2, 2, 2, 2))
plot(income ~ age, data = sdat, col = "blue", main = "Before")
plot(income ~ age, data = transformed, col = "blue", main = "After")
```

Some readers may have found that the above code does not seem to standardize the data before transformation. Recall the introduction of KNN, `preProcess()`  with `method="knnImpute"` by default will standardize data.

## Collinearity {#collinearity}

It is probably the technical term known by the most un-technical people. When two predictors are very strongly correlated, including both in a model may lead to confusion or problem with a singular matrix. There is an excellent function in `corrplot` package with the same name `corrplot()` that can visualize correlation structure of a set of predictors. The function has the option to reorder the variables in a way that reveals clusters of highly correlated ones. 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# select non-survey numerical variables
sdat <- subset(sim.dat, select = c("age", "income", "store_exp", 
    "online_exp", "store_trans", "online_trans"))
# use bagging imputation here
imp <- preProcess(sdat, method = "bagImpute")
sdat <- predict(imp, sdat)
# get the correlation matrix
correlation <- cor(sdat)
# plot
par(oma = c(2, 2, 2, 2))
corrplot.mixed(correlation, order = "hclust", tl.pos = "lt", 
    upper = "ellipse")
```

<!--Here use `corrplot.mixed()` function to visualize the correlation matrix (figure \@ref(fig:corp)).-->
The closer the correlation is to 0, the lighter the color is and the closer the shape is to a circle. The elliptical means the correlation is not equal to 0 (because we set the `upper = "ellipse"`), the greater the correlation, the narrower the ellipse. Blue represents a positive correlation; red represents a negative correlation. The direction of the ellipse also changes with the correlation. The correlation coefficient is shown in the lower triangle of the matrix. 

The variables relationship from previous scatter matrix are clear here: the negative correlation between age and online shopping, the positive correlation between income and amount of purchasing. Some correlation is very strong ( such as the correlation between `online_trans` and`age` is `r correlation['online_trans','age']`) which means the two variables contain duplicate information. 

Section 3.5 of “Applied Predictive Modeling” [@APM] presents a heuristic algorithm to remove a minimum number of predictors to ensure all pairwise correlations are below a certain threshold:

> 
(1) Calculate the correlation matrix of the predictors.
(2) Determine the two predictors associated with the largest absolute pairwise correlation (call them predictors A and B).
(3) Determine the average correlation between A and the other variables. Do the same for predictor B.
(4) If A has a larger average correlation, remove it; otherwise, remove predictor B.
(5) Repeat Step 2-4 until no absolute correlations are above the threshold.

The `findCorrelation()` function in package `caret` will apply the above algorithm.

```{r}
(highCorr <- findCorrelation(cor(sdat), cutoff = 0.7))
```

It returns the index of columns need to be deleted. It tells us that we need to remove the first column to make sure the correlations are all below 0.7.

```r
# delete highly correlated columns
sdat <- sdat[-highCorr]
# check the new correlation matrix
(cor(sdat))
```

The absolute value of the elements in the correlation matrix after removal are all below 0.7. How strong does a correlation have to get, before you should start worrying about multicollinearity? There is no easy answer to that question. You can treat the threshold as a tuning parameter and pick one that gives you best prediction accuracy. 

## Sparse Variables

Other than the highly related predictors, predictors with degenerate distributions can cause the problem too.  Removing those variables can significantly improve some models’ performance and stability (such as linear regression and logistic regression but the tree based model is impervious to this type of predictors). One extreme example is a variable with a single value which is called zero-variance variable. Variables with very low frequency of unique values are near-zero variance predictors. In general, detecting those variables follows two rules: 

- The fraction of unique values over the sample size 
- The ratio of the frequency of the most prevalent value to the frequency of the second most prevalent value. 

`nearZeroVar()` function in the `caret` package can filter near-zero variance predictors according to the above rules. In order to show the useage of the function, let's arbitaryly add some problematic variables to the origional data `sim.dat`:

```{r}
# make a copy
zero_demo <- sim.dat
# add two sparse variable zero1 only has one unique value zero2 is a
# vector with the first element 1 and the rest are 0s
zero_demo$zero1 <- rep(1, nrow(zero_demo))
zero_demo$zero2 <- c(1, rep(0, nrow(zero_demo) - 1))
```

The function will return a vector of integers indicating which columns to remove:

```{r}
nearZeroVar(zero_demo,freqCut = 95/5, uniqueCut = 10)
```

As expected, it returns the two columns we generated. You can go ahead to remove them. Note the two arguments in the function `freqCut =` and `uniqueCut =` are corresponding to the previous two rules.

- `freqCut`: the cutoff for the ratio of the most common value to the second most common value
- `uniqueCut`: the cutoff for the percentage of distinct values out of the number of total samples

## Re-encode Dummy Variables

A dummy variable is a binary variable (0/1) to represent subgroups of the sample.  Sometimes we need to recode categories to smaller bits of information named “dummy variables.”  For example, some questionnaires have five options for each question, A, B, C, D, and E. After you get the data, you will usually convert the corresponding categorical variables for each question into five nominal variables, and then use one of the options as the baseline. 

Let's encode `gender` and `house` from `sim.dat` to dummy variables. There are two ways to implement this. The first is to use `class.ind()` from `nnet` package. However, it only works on one variable at a time.

```{r}
dumVar <- nnet::class.ind(sim.dat$gender)
head(dumVar)
```

Since it is redundant to keep both, we need to remove one of them when modeling. Another more powerful function is `dummyVars()` from `caret`:

```{r}
# use "origional variable name + level" as new name
dumMod <- dummyVars(~gender + house + income, 
                    data = sim.dat, 
                    levelsOnly = F)
head(predict(dumMod, sim.dat))
```

`dummyVars()` can also use formula format. The variable on the right-hand side can be both categorical and numeric. For a numerical variable, the function will keep the variable unchanged. The advantage is that you can apply the function to a data frame without removing numerical variables. Other than that, the function can create interaction term:

```{r}
dumMod <- dummyVars(~gender + house + income + income:gender, 
                    data = sim.dat, 
                    levelsOnly = F)
head(predict(dumMod, sim.dat))
```

If you think the impact income levels on purchasing behavior is different for male and female, then you may add the interaction term between `income` and `gender`. You can do this by adding `income: gender` in the formula.
