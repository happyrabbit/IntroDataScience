# Preface{-}

During the early years of our career as data scientists, we were bewildered by all kinds of data science hype. There is a lack of definition of many basic terminologies such as "big data," "artificial intelligence," and "data science." How big is big data? What is data science? What is the difference between the sexy title "Data Scientist" and the traditional "Data Analyst?" The term data science stirs so many associations such as machine learning, deep learning, data mining, pattern recognition. All those struck us as confusing and vague as real-world data scientists! However, we always feel something tangible in data science applications, and it has been developing very fast. After applying data science for many years, we now have a much better idea about data science in general. This book is our endeavor to make data science a more concrete and legitimate field. In addition to "hard" technical aspects, the book also covers soft skills and career development in data science. 

## Goal of the Book {-}

This is a book on data science with a specific focus on industrial experience. Data Science is a cross-disciplinary subject involving hands-on experience and business problem-solving exposures. The majority of existing introduction books on data science are about the modeling techniques and the implementation of models using R or Python. However, many of these books lack the context of the industrial environment. Moreover, a crucial part, the art of data science in practice, is often missing. This book intends to fill the gap.

Some key features of this book are as follows:

- It covers both technical and soft skills.

- It has a chapter dedicated to the big data cloud environment. In the industry, the practice of data science is often in such an environment.

- It is hands-on. We provide the data and **repeatable** R and Python code in notebooks. Readers can repeat the analysis in the book using the data and code provided. We also suggest that readers modify the notebook to perform their analyses with their data and problems whenever possible. The best way to learn data science is to do it!

- It focuses on the skills needed to solve real-world industrial problems rather than an academic book.

## Who This Book Is For {-}

This book is for readers who want to explore potential data science career paths and eventually want to become a data scientist. Traditional data-related practitioners such as statisticians, business analysts, and data analysts will find this book helpful in expanding their skills for future data science careers. Undergraduate and graduate students with data or analyst related major or minor will find this book helpful to learn real-world data science applications. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the reproducibility of the companion R and python codes. Readers need to understand basic statistical concepts, such as correlation and simple linear regression \index{linear regression} analysis. While the book is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background such as linear algebra and optimization is good for the optional deep dive of under the hood mechanism for advanced topics behind applications.

## What This Book Covers {-}

We first introduce the basic ideas of data science and then cover data science career paths, project cycles, soft skills, and common pitfalls based on industry and real-world scenarios. We then introduce typical big data cloud platforms and use R library `sparklyr` \index{sparklyr} to explore Spark's power for data preprocessing and traditional statistical and machine learning model development. The next few chapters cover common statistical and machine learning models and strategies such as data preprocessing, data wrangling, model tuning, performance measuring, regression methods, regularization, and tree-based methods. In the end, we introduce three types of deep learning models and their applications to image and text data. We use R as the text's programming language and provide most of the Python codes in GitHub. Refer to this page (https://github.com/happyrabbit/IntroDataScience/) for a table with the notebooks' links.

# About the Authors {-}

**Hui Lin** is currently a Quant Researcher at Google. Before joining Google, Hui held
different roles in data science. She was the head of data science at Netlify where she built
and led the data science team and a Data Scientist at DuPont where she did a broad range
of predictive analytics and market research analysis. She is the co-founder of Central
Iowa R User Group, blogger of https://scientistcafe.com/, and 2018 Program Chair of
ASA Statistics in Marketing Section. She enjoys making analytics accessible to a broad
audience and teaches tutorials and workshops for practitioners on data science. She holds
MS and Ph.D. in statistics from Iowa State University.

**Ming Li** is currently a Senior Research Scientist at Amazon and an Adjunct Instructor of University of Washington. He was the Chair of Quality & Productivity Section of American Statistical Association for 2017. He was a Data Scientist at Walmart and a Statistical Leader at General Electric Global Research Center. He obtained his Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University at 2010. With deep statistics background and a few years’ experience in data science, he has trained and mentored numerous junior data scientist with different background such as statistician, programmer, software developer and business analyst. He was also an instructor of Amazon’s internal Machine Learning University and was one of the key founding members of Walmart’s Analytics Rotational Program.
